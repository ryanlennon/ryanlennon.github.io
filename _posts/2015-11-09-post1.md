##There are a lot of resources out there
It can be hard just figuring out where to start and what to learn.

One of the first sites that helped me in the beginning was [Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/). 

They are a great free beginner site and have a lot of different options you can choose from to get a better idea of what direction you may want to go:

*  Are you looking into designing web sites? 
*  Maybe working behind the scenes on the back-end? 
*  Mobile applications could peak your interest. 

Go have a look and see for yourself, did I mention they are **_FREE_**? All you need is an email to sign up and you can take any of the many different tutorials that they offer (They have added a lot more since I last took a course from there). If you have no idea where to start they offer to put you on a "track" based on your interests (which I believe they charge for but could be well worth it.)

In the beginning, while navigating through the tutorials at [Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/), I was focused mainly on HTML, CSS, and Javascript. After completing those courses I wanted to move on to the next step, but after step 1 there really isnt a step 2 layed out for you to take in coding.

I decided my next step would be to teach myself other languages and learn as much as I could. I found out quickly that this wasn't a good second step. While learning a new language I soon forgot much of what I had learned previously. Basically if you dont apply what you have learned then it's very hard to retain that information.

This is where things got frustrating. So I went back to researching my next steps and came up with my own process.

1. Codacademy (linked above) tutorials = beginniner/getting started
2. [Code School](https://www.codeschool.com/) = Help further expand what you have learned with problem sets.
3. [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/) = More purposeful programming. Project orientated and website or application building
4. [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) = Has tutorials from experienced web designer and can be more challenging
5. A coding bootcamp = A good one will have multiple languages from front and backend to bring everything together and you should get to peer program, work on bigger projects, and get more of guided approach with mentors that have been in the same positon you are. 

There is a great [Free code camp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/) online to check out and it has a great outline to get you from beginning to end. It's great if you are self driven and want to go at your own pace. 

I signed up for a part-time coding bootcamp in Chicago called ACLTC (Anyone Can Learn to Code). There are many others so do your research. [ACLTC](http://www.anyonecanlearntocode.com/) allows you to keep your day job while you attend classes at night and on the weekend. Currently, I am in my 3rd week and am learning at much faster rate than I did on my own! It does help to have some knowledge going in, but it's not a requirement.
